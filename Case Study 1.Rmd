The Micro Finance market in the Philippines is developing as a result of the increased demand for financial inclusion, particularly among long-income households and small business owners. The growth of microfinance services is being supported by government programs and participation from global financial institutions. Access to microfinance products is being improved by the growing use of mobile banking and digital payment systems. Demand for microloans and financial services tailored to underprivileged groups is also being driven by the growth of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) and rural enterprises

Microfinance institutions (MFIs) play a significant role in advancing financial inclusion in the Philippines, with a presence in 80% of municipalities and cities. According to the [@bsp_speech_2021], 9% of Filipino adults maintain accounts with MFIs, positioning them the third most preferred account provider after e-money issuers and banks. It was reported that 23% of Filipino borrowers sourced their loans from MFIs in 2021, surpassing government institutions, cooperatives, and lending-financing institutions. Despite the significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a contraction in loan growth and a sharp decline in repayment rates, the microfinance sector has shown resilience, with loan growth rebounding and repayment rates recovering steadily by early 2021. 

MFIs, including 139 banks, microfinance NGOs with portfolios of ₱50.4 billion, and cooperatives with ₱288 billion in loans, enable microentrepreneurs to access credit without collateral and simple requirements, empowering many to “graduate” into formal banking. The BSP actively supports this sector by promoting credit access through guarantee programs and encouraging digitalization initiatives such as the Paleng-QR Ph and satellite technology for rural banks, which have proven essential during crises like typhoons
